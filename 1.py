# On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
#
# For example:
#
# 1abc2
# pqr3stu8vwx
# a1b2c3d4e5f
# treb7uchet
#
# In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
#
# Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
